This does not affect critical glitches, only regular glitches.

Level 2 dependents are more stable costs, like the support of a high-maintenance significant other, a child, or a small family. This level costs the Stalker 10% of every score. Level 3 dependents are rare in the Zone, because most Stalkers don't have a regular family and a second life outside the Zone, which is what this level entails. This level costs the Stalker 25% of all their scores. For purposes of this quality, a “score” is any income that comes their way. Job payments, fencing stolen goods, or even gambling winnings.

If the same tenet is broken multiple times or broken again during the twenty-four hour period, each infraction adds another forty-eight hours onto the initial twenty-four.

See the Honorbound sidebar for some sample codes and tenets (CRB p. 77).

Each point of Karma spent also puts you 5,000 rubles into debt with someone very dangerous and capable of collecting. You must repay interest at a rate of 200 rubles per level of this quality, which addresses interest only, not principal. If the payment is not made, the lenders come searching for you. The quality can be bought off purely with money; if the principal is repaid the quality is eliminated. This quality can be obtained only during character creation, not during gameplay.

quality.scb_marked_by_the_zone.desc=You carry a visible mutation, scar, or unique mark that sets you apart in the unforgiving landscapes of the Zone. This distinctive feature is not only a physical reminder of the unpredictable nature of the Zone but also a beacon that makes your character easily recognizable.

You are unable to gain or use Edge while the object of your prejudice is present (unless you're attacking them).\n\nNote: Gamemasters and players should use this quality carefully. Everyone in the group should be on board with it being used, and it should never be used as a veiled excuse to state real-world prejudices or verbally attack, either directly or indirectly, other players.

quality.scb_radiation_sensitivity.desc=You exhibit a heightened sensitivity to radiation, experiencing its effects more rapidly and intensely than others around you. Whether this susceptibility stems from a specific incident or is an inherent trait, the consequences of radiation exposure manifest more acutely for you.\n\nGame Effect: Choose the level of your radiation sensitivity. At Level 1 sensitivity, you exhibit weak resistance to radiation and its afflictions compared to the average person. Consequently, you are unable to gain or spend edge on tests made to resist or heal radiation.

In addition to the penalties from Level 1, you suffer an additional point of radiation whenever your body absorbs radiation.

quality.scb_social_stress.desc=There is a social situation that simply does not work for you, like being in large groups,talking to new people, being the center of attention, being out of the spotlight, or a myriad of other situations that some folks find totally normal but you find ridiculously stressful.\n\nGame Effect: Select a specific social stressor.

quality.scb_unsteady_hands.desc=Nervous tics, excessive caffeine intake, or a general clumsiness might be the cause, but the results are all the same: You can't draw a straight line to save your life. You also have a real hard time typing, tying your shoes, and keeping a gun sight on the target.\n\nGame Effect: You cannot spend Edge on any test using Agility that directly involves your hands (that is, a Stealth test to pull off sleight of-hand would directly involve the hands, as would an Attack test with any weapon held in the hands, but an Athletics test involving running would not, even though the hands are in motion while running).

quality.scb_weak_immune_system.desc=Perpetual sniffles are annoying to both you and your team, but a poorly timed sneeze or a sudden need for a bathroom can mean the end of a goodrun. You're sick almost all the time. It may just be a minor cold, or it could be a nasty case of influenza or worse, but you've never met an infection you didn't want to take home and hang out with for a bit.\n\nGame Effect: You cannot spend Edge to resist the effects of an infection.
